 FINAL SUBMISSION FOR 2D PROJECT 

i wasn't able to add the narrative theme for this project as time did not allow 

the main game is travelling through the different rooms and defeating all the monsters

you know you've won the game if you search all the rooms and you do not see any monsters

i decided to go against locking the boss till the end and insted let the player choose the order they fight in 

however i do feel pretty happy with the final result
